## Questions

THink about it. How do those queues work without setting TAS on board?

## Answer

> A cycle time of 1/100 seconds = 10 millisecond is a lot longer than the time needed to complete one schedule
run-through. After the schedule has finished within a cycle, the gates remain in the last configured state until
the end of the cycle

Probabily every gates are always open.
